# NOAA-JennyVP
My name is [Jenny Vander Pluym](http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/profiles/apr11/vander-pluym.html) and I am a Marine Biologist with NOAA. I split my time between characterizing fish and benthic communities of hardbottom reefs and preparing scientific communications products that summarize our research for public consumption on the web. Most recently I have worked on:
1.Fish Community characterization of offshore hardbottom reefs of North Carolina
2.Fish and coral community monitoring of Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary
3.The NCCOS News, a weekly newsletter for our organization

##Tools of Marine Ecology
1. ArcGIS for mapping
2. R for statistical analyses
3. SCUBA for in water data collection

##Is this the right copy?
